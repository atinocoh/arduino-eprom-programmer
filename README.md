GNU-Linux/Windows C++ Qt 5 Application for Arduino Eprom Programmer 

Tool for programming SNES and ZX Spectrum roms using an Arduino Mega with a custom hardware add-on, for retrocomputing or whatever. It is easily modifiable to include more types of EPROMs.

## Usage:
The program allows reading/writing from/to the EPROM. Originally designed by Robson Couto, I modified his Arduino sketch and his hardware design to allow 27256K ZXSpectrum EPROMs to be read/written (few cables and some jumpers). 

I developed my own Qt application to comunicate with the device and give the project a fancy look.
